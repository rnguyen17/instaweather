React Tutorial App (Sandbox Weather App)

**Welcome to Instaweather**

This app is one of my first React apps. It demonstrates basic routing, http requests to API endpoints, and some primitive management of internal state. There is still a **LOT** of work to be done (cleaning up CSS files, moving state into a single state tree via Redux, module management, etc.), but there will be more features to the app. This is just a basic intro to React, Webpack 2.0, and module management via imports and require(). View the deployed project at https://instaweather-3822b.firebaseapp.com/

**Instructions**

Make sure you have the latest version of node and npm. To download all required modules, clone the repo, cd to the project path and run *npm install*. Afterwards, use *npm run start* to start your local web server

```javascript
npm install
npm run start
```
